## What This Update Includes

### Backend Enhanced Logging (netlify/functions/signals.mjs):
- Comprehensive subscription validation debugging
- Detailed logs showing user access decisions
- Clear denial reasons for expired subscriptions

### Frontend Enhanced Error Handling (client/src/pages/Signals.tsx):
- Detailed error analysis for subscription failures
- Enhanced 403 error detection
- Improved upgrade prompt triggering

### Database Testing (test-subscription-access.mjs):
- Confirmed Almeerah user has expired subscription
- Status: expired, End Date: 2025-08-14 (yesterday)
- Should show upgrade prompt instead of signals

## Expected Results After Deployment

When Almeerah user visits dashboard:
1. Backend should log subscription denial
2. Frontend should receive 403 error
3. User should see "Upgrade Your Plan" instead of signals
4. Console logs will show complete validation flow

## Issue Identification
Database confirms subscription logic should work - debugging will pinpoint where frontend/backend enforcement fails.
