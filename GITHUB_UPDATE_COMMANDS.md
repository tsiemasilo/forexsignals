✅ **Signals CRUD**: Complete PUT/DELETE methods for admin interface

✅ **South African Localization**: R49.99/month pricing maintained  

The subscription system is working exactly as you wanted - admins can control user access, and inactive users see compelling upgrade messaging instead of error messages.
