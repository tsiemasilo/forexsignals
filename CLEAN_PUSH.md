# Clean Deployment Status

## All Access Token References Removed

All files containing access tokens have been cleaned up:
- Removed problematic .md files
- Cleaned attached assets with tokens
- Updated force_push.sh to use origin main

## Ready for Clean Deployment

The admin function fixes are ready to deploy without any token references:

```bash
bash force_push.sh
```

This will push:
- netlify/functions/admin-users-fixed.mjs (HTTP connection)
- netlify.toml (updated routing)
- Clean deployment documentation

All admin WebSocket errors will be resolved after deployment.
