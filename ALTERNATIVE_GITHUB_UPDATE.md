# Alternative GitHub Update Methods

Since git operations are restricted in this environment, here are alternative ways to update your GitHub repository:

## Method 1: Direct GitHub Web Upload (Recommended)

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/Almeerah/watchlist-fx
2. **Upload key files directly**:
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Upload the entire `netlify/` folder (drag and drop)
   - Upload these documentation files:
     - `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
     - `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` 
     - `GITHUB_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
     - Updated `replit.md`
     - `build-netlify.js`

## Method 2: GitHub CLI (if available locally)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
# Then authenticate with your token
gh auth login --with-token < echo "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"

# Clone your repo
gh repo clone Almeerah/watchlist-fx
cd watchlist-fx

# Copy files from this Replit workspace
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Netlify serverless conversion - production ready"
git push origin main
```

## Method 3: Download Archive and Upload

I've created `watchlist-fx-netlify-complete.tar.gz` with all the files. You can:
1. Download this archive from your Replit workspace
2. Extract it locally
3. Upload the contents to your GitHub repository
