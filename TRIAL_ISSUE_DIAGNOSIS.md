# Trial Issue Diagnosis

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
Admin dashboard trial setup is being overridden or not persisting properly.

## 📊 **Log Analysis**
From the workflow logs, I can see:
- **7:44:46 - 7:45:12**: Trial working, returning 200 responses
- **7:45:16**: Suddenly switches to 403 "Active subscription required"  
- **7:45:17**: Status changes to "inactive"
- **7:45:24**: Status changes to "expired"
- **7:45:31+**: Status back to "trial" but still 403 errors

## 🔍 **Root Causes**
1. **Database Race Condition**: Multiple subscription updates happening simultaneously
2. **Cache/Session Issue**: Frontend/backend not seeing latest database state
3. **Admin Panel Bug**: Trial setup not properly configuring end dates

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**
1. **Direct Database Fix**: Set proper 7-day trial with future end date
2. **Backend Validation**: Ensure trial logic matches (status='trial' AND endDate > now)
3. **Session Refresh**: User needs to log out/in to get fresh session data

## 🎯 **Expected After Fix**
- Almeerah should have valid 7-day trial
- Status: "trial" with 7 days remaining  
- Access: Should see signals instead of upgrade prompt
- Duration: Trial valid until August 22, 2025

Trial has been fixed at database level - user should log out and back in to refresh session.
