# Netlify Frontend Update Issue

## Problem Identified
The signals are still showing on https://watchlistfx.netlify.app/ because:

✅ **Backend API Working**: `/api/signals` correctly returns "Active subscription required"  
✅ **Subscription Status**: User shows as "inactive" properly  
❌ **Frontend Not Updated**: Deployed Netlify site has old signals page code  

## Root Cause
The enhanced subscription blocking UI in `client/src/pages/Signals.tsx` hasn't been deployed to Netlify yet. The live site still has the old version that doesn't properly handle the 403 subscription errors.

## Current Status
- **Replit Dev**: Enhanced UI working (shows upgrade prompt)
- **Netlify Live**: Old UI (still shows signals despite 403 errors)

## Solution Required
Deploy the updated frontend code to Netlify by pushing to GitHub, which will trigger Netlify rebuild:

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add client/src/pages/Signals.tsx netlify/functions/signals-fixed.mjs netlify/functions/auth.mjs netlify.toml
git commit -m "FRONTEND SUBSCRIPTION BLOCKING: Updated signals page to properly block inactive users with upgrade prompt"
git push https://tsiemasilo:$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FOREX@github.com/tsiemasilo/forexsignals.git main
```

## What This Will Fix
After deployment, inactive users will see the enhanced upgrade prompt instead of signals, matching the working Replit development version.

## Test After Deployment
1. Visit https://watchlistfx.netlify.app/ with inactive user
2. Should see "Upgrade Your Plan" message instead of signals
3. "Choose Your Plan" button should redirect to pricing
