ðŸ”§ Admin Interface Issue Resolution

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Admin interface trying to update user ID 29
- User 29 doesn't exist in production database
- Available users: 3, 7, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED:
âœ“ Enhanced error handling to show 404 status for missing users
âœ“ Better error messages with available user IDs for debugging
âœ“ Auto-refresh functionality when users not found
âœ“ Improved error feedback in admin interface

NEXT STEPS:
1. The admin interface needs fresh data to show only existing users
2. Manual page refresh may be needed to clear cached user data
3. Enhanced validation prevents errors for non-existent users
