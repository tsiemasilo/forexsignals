# Final Clean Deployment

## Issue Resolved
Removed hardcoded token from simple_deploy.sh and replaced with environment variable.

## Clean Files Ready:
- netlify/functions/admin-users-fixed.mjs (HTTP database connection)
- netlify.toml (routing configuration)  
- All token references removed from files

## Deployment Command:
```bash
bash simple_deploy.sh
```

This will deploy the HTTP-based admin functions to fix WebSocket errors on Netlify.
