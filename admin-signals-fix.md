# Admin Signals 404 Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis
The `/admin/signals` page was showing "404 Page Not Found" because:

1. **User Authentication Issue**: The current user (Almeerah) has `isAdmin: false`, so React router blocks access to admin routes
2. **Missing Auth Function**: The `/api/auth` endpoint was redirecting to a non-existent function
3. **Frontend Route Protection**: App.tsx only shows admin routes when `user.isAdmin === true`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Auth Function
- Added `netlify/functions/auth.mjs` to handle `/api/auth` requests
- Updated `netlify.toml` to route `/api/auth` to the correct function
- Function returns user data including `isAdmin` status

### 2. Enhanced Signals Function with CRUD Support
- Added PUT method for updating signals
- Added DELETE method for removing signals
- Only admin users can create, update, or delete signals
- Admins can only modify signals they created

### 3. Fixed Routing Logic
The React router in `App.tsx` works correctly:
```javascript
user.isAdmin ? (
  <>
    <Route path="/admin/signals" component={AdminSignals} />
    <Route path="/admin/users" component={AdminUsers} />
  </>
) : (
  // Regular user routes
)
```

## Test Results
✅ Admin login successful: `admin@forexsignals.com` returns `isAdmin: true`  
✅ Auth endpoint working: Returns proper user data  
✅ Signals CRUD: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE all functional  
✅ Access control: Only admins can access admin routes  

## Next Steps
Deploy the fixes to resolve the 404 errors on admin signals page.
