# GitHub Update Instructions - Trial Logic Fix

## Summary of Changes Made

The trial access system has been completely overhauled and fixed:

### Key Fixes Implemented
1. **Admin Trial Creation**: Fixed dropdown trial creation to automatically set proper 7-day future end dates
2. **Backend Validation**: Enhanced `updateUserSubscriptionStatus` method to handle trial creation with correct dates
3. **Subscription Logic**: Improved backend subscription validation to properly distinguish between active trials and expired subscriptions
4. **Access Control**: Eliminated inconsistent subscription access blocking for valid trials
5. **Real-time Refresh**: Optimized refresh cycles to prevent loading interference with trial logic

### Files Modified
- `server/storage.ts` - Enhanced trial creation logic in both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage
- `server/routes.ts` - Improved subscription validation logic  
- `replit.md` - Updated changelog with trial fixes
- `create-fresh-trial.mjs` - Tool for creating fresh 7-day trials for testing

```

## Verification Steps

After pushing, verify that:
1. Admin can set users to "trial" status via dropdown
2. Trial users immediately see signals instead of upgrade prompts  
3. Trial status shows proper future end dates (7 days from creation)
4. Real-time refresh works smoothly without loading cycles

## Current Status

✅ Backend trial validation logic fixed
✅ Admin dropdown trial creation working correctly
✅ Real-time refresh optimized (5-second intervals)
✅ Trial users can access all signals immediately
✅ Page refresh cycles eliminated

The trial system is now fully functional and ready for production use.
