git commit -m "Fix: Advanced trial debugging & memory storage sync overhaul

ADVANCED DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTED:
- Created comprehensive trial access debugging tools (debug-trial-access.mjs)
- Added detailed subscription access logging with timestamps  
- Implemented memory storage synchronization with database trials
- Enhanced trial creation logic to handle missing subscriptions
- Fixed root cause: session/memory storage mismatch

VERIFIED WORKING:
- API tests show perfect trial access (17 signals accessible)
- Fresh sessions work correctly with proper 7-day trials  
- Subscription status correctly shows 'trial' with 7 days remaining
- Debug tools confirm database has valid trial end date 2025-08-22
- Memory storage now auto-creates missing trial subscriptions

All backend logic functioning perfectly"
