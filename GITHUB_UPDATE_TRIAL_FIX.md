# GitHub Update Instructions - Session Isolation & Trial Logic Complete Fix

## Summary of Changes Made

Both session isolation and trial access systems have been completely overhauled and fixed:

### Session Isolation Enhancements
1. **Session Regeneration**: Added session regeneration on login to prevent session fixation attacks
2. **Custom Session Config**: Enhanced session configuration with custom name "forexSignalsSession" and security settings
3. **Enhanced Logout**: Improved logout functionality with proper session destruction and logging
4. **Rolling Sessions**: Added rolling sessions that refresh on user activity
5. **Security Features**: Added SameSite cookie protection and httpOnly flags
6. **Admin Tools**: Created admin session cleanup endpoint for debugging session issues

### Trial Access Logic Fixes
1. **Admin Trial Creation**: Fixed dropdown trial creation to automatically set proper 7-day future end dates
2. **Backend Validation**: Enhanced `updateUserSubscriptionStatus` method to handle trial creation with correct dates
3. **Subscription Logic**: Improved backend subscription validation to properly distinguish between active trials and expired subscriptions
4. **Access Control**: Eliminated inconsistent subscription access blocking for valid trials
5. **Real-time Refresh**: Optimized refresh cycles to prevent loading interference with trial logic

### Files Modified
- `server/storage.ts` - Enhanced trial creation logic in both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage
- `server/routes.ts` - Improved subscription validation logic  
- `replit.md` - Updated changelog with trial fixes
- `create-fresh-trial.mjs` - Tool for creating fresh 7-day trials for testing

git push https://tsiemasilo:${PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FOREX}@github.com/tsiemasilo/forexsignals.git main
```

## Verification Steps

After pushing, verify that:
1. Admin can set users to "trial" status via dropdown
2. Trial users immediately see signals instead of upgrade prompts  
3. Trial status shows proper future end dates (7 days from creation)
4. Real-time refresh works smoothly without loading cycles

## Current Status

✅ Backend trial validation logic fixed
✅ Admin dropdown trial creation working correctly
✅ Real-time refresh optimized (5-second intervals)
✅ Trial users can access all signals immediately
✅ Page refresh cycles eliminated

The trial system is now fully functional and ready for production use.
