# Subscription Access Issue Identified

## 🚨 **Issue Found**
Live Netlify site (https://watchlistfx.netlify.app/) is showing signals to inactive users when it should block them.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The live Netlify deployment has an older version of the subscription access control logic. Local development properly blocks inactive users with 403 errors, but the live site bypasses this check.

## ✅ **Local vs Live Comparison**

### Local Development (Working Correctly)
- ✅ Inactive users get 403 "Active subscription required" 
- ✅ Upgrade prompt shown instead of signals
- ✅ Auto-refresh working with proper error handling
- ✅ Admin access unlimited

### Live Site (Issue)
- ❌ Inactive users still see signals
- ❌ Subscription blocking not enforced
- ❌ Old function code deployed

## 🚀 **Solution**
Deploy updated netlify/functions/signals.mjs with strict subscription validation:

```bash
git add netlify/functions/signals.mjs
git commit -m "SUBSCRIPTION ACCESS FIX: Block inactive users"
git push https://tsiemasilo:$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FOREX@github.com/tsiemasilo/forexsignals.git main
```

## 📋 **Expected After Fix**
1. Almeerah (inactive user) will see upgrade prompt on live site
2. Only active subscribers can view signals  
3. 403 errors properly enforced
4. Real-time auto-refresh continues working for authorized users

The fix will restore proper subscription access control on the live site.
