ðŸ”„ Netlify Functions Updated to Match Development Logic

Key Updates Applied:
âœ“ Active subscription creation now matches development plan lookup and duration calculation
âœ“ Inactive subscriptions use proper past date for end_date to ensure inactive status
âœ“ Expired subscriptions maintain exact development behavior
âœ“ Enhanced logging matches development console output patterns
âœ“ Error handling improved with better validation

Function Compatibility:
- Trial creation endpoint working: /api/admin/users/{id}/create-trial (POST)
- Subscription update endpoint: /api/admin/users/{id}/subscription (PUT)
- User listing endpoint: /api/admin/users (GET)

Ready for GitHub commit and Netlify deployment trigger.
