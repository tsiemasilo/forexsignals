# Simple Fix for Days Calculation Issue

## Current Status
- ✅ Netlify built successfully  
- ❌ Same asset hash (index-CdC9C5KV.js) - old code deployed
- ✅ Backend calculations are perfect (verified via debug API)
- ❌ Frontend still shows old admin interface

## Root Cause
The GitHub repository doesn't contain our debugging system code, so Netlify deployed the old version.

## Immediate Solution
Since the backend is working perfectly and we know the exact issue (frontend cache not invalidating), we can implement a simple fix directly in the current AdminUsers component.

## Simple Fix Strategy
Add a small cache invalidation mechanism to the existing admin dashboard that forces refresh when subscription plans change.

This will immediately resolve the days calculation display issue without needing the full debugging system.
