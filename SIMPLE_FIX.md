# Simple Production Fix - Immediate Implementation

## Current Status
- Asset hash unchanged: `index-CdC9C5KV.js` 
- GitHub push appears incomplete or Netlify not rebuilding
- Backend calculations perfect: all API tests successful

## Immediate Solution Strategy

Since the comprehensive debugging system hasn't deployed yet, I can implement a targeted fix directly in the production codebase using the simplest possible approach.

### Quick Fix Approach
1. Remove all debugging component dependencies
2. Implement basic but effective cache invalidation
3. Add forced refresh mechanism
4. Ensure clean build without import errors

### Expected Result
Once this simpler fix deploys:
- Asset hash will change (indicating successful deployment)
- Admin subscription changes will trigger cache clearing
- Page refresh will ensure UI updates
- Days calculation display will be accurate

### Implementation
Focus on core cache invalidation without advanced debugging components:
- `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
- `refetch()` calls
- `setTimeout(() => window.location.reload(), 1000)`

This minimalist approach will resolve the issue while avoiding build complications.âœ… Fixed Invalid Date issue in PhoneSignalsPage.tsx
- Problem: Using signal.createdAt instead of signal.created_at from API
- Solution: Added fallback for both snake_case and camelCase formats
- Safe handling: Shows 'Now' if neither date field exists
