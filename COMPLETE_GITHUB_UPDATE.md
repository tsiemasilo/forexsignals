# Complete GitHub Update Commands

The push was blocked due to access tokens in the files. Run these commands to complete the update:

```bash
# Remove access tokens from files and commit
git add ADMIN_FUNCTIONS_GITHUB_UPDATE.md push_admin_fixes.sh
git commit -m "Remove access tokens from documentation files"
git push origin main
```

This will:
1. Remove the blocked access tokens from the files  
2. Complete the GitHub push
3. Trigger Netlify deployment with the fixed admin functions

After running these commands, wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to deploy, then test:
- Admin users endpoint should connect to database (no WebSocket errors)
- Admin signals should show real data from signals table

The admin function fixes are ready - just need to complete this final push.
