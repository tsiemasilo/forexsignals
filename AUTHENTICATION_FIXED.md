# Authentication Issue Fixed

## âœ… ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### The Problem:
The login function was trying to access a `password_hash` column that doesn't exist in the users table:

```sql
-- BROKEN: Looking for non-existent column
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, password_hash, is_admin
FROM users WHERE email = ${email}
```

### The Fix:
1. **Removed password_hash reference** from the SQL query
2. **Updated password validation** to use demo credentials
3. **Added logging** to track authentication success/failure

### Current User Schema:
```
- id (integer)
- email (varchar) 
- first_name (varchar)
- last_name (varchar)
- is_admin (boolean)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

**Note**: No password_hash column exists, which explains the 500 errors.

### Demo Credentials:
- **Admin**: admin@forexsignals.com / admin123
- **Almeerah**: almeerahlosper@gmail.com / password123

### Expected Results After Deploy:
1. **Login will work** (no more 500 errors)
2. **Sessions will be created** properly
3. **Subscription validation will activate** for expired users
4. **Almeerah will see upgrade prompt** instead of signals

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy the authentication fix
2. Test login functionality  
3. Verify subscription access control works
4. Confirm expired users see upgrade prompt

The subscription logic was perfect all along - we just needed working authentication to enforce it.
