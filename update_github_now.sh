SESSION ISOLATION ENHANCEMENTS:
- Added session regeneration on login to prevent session fixation attacks
- Enhanced session configuration with custom name and security settings
- Improved logout functionality with proper session destruction
- Added rolling sessions and SameSite cookie protection
- Created admin session cleanup endpoint for debugging

TRIAL ACCESS LOGIC FIXES:
- Fixed admin dropdown trial creation to set proper 7-day future end dates
- Enhanced updateUserSubscriptionStatus method for correct trial handling
- Improved backend subscription validation to distinguish active trials from expired
- Eliminated conflicting subscription access checks blocking valid trials
- Optimized real-time refresh cycles to prevent loading interference

VERIFIED WORKING:
- Different users now get isolated sessions on login
- Trial users see signals immediately instead of upgrade prompts
- Admin can create trials that work instantly with proper 7-day periods
- Real-time dashboard updates every 5 seconds without interference
- Session sharing between users completely eliminated

All session and trial functionality working correctly in production"
