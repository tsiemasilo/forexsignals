git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: Admin trial corruption completely resolved

âœ… ADMIN PANEL TRIAL CREATION NOW WORKING
- Fixed admin route logic that was corrupting trials
- Added early exit mechanism to prevent double method calls
- Implemented safety checks for trial duration validation
- Test suite confirms 7-day trials created properly

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Root cause: admin route calling both updateUserSubscriptionStatus() and updateUserSubscriptionWithPlan()
- Fix: Force early exit after trial creation to prevent corruption
- Added duration validation and auto-correction
- Comprehensive test script validates fix works perfectly

ðŸŽ¯ RESULTS
- Admin can safely select 'Free Trial' from dropdown
- Always creates proper 7-day trials (never expired)  
- 18 signals accessible immediately after trial creation
- No more 'error loading signals' or expiration issues

This resolves the core issue where admin panel changes would corrupt user trials."
