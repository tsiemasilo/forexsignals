## What This Fixes

**Root Cause**: Admin signals page showed 404 because non-admin users cannot access admin routes

**Solutions**:
1. **Auth Function**: New `/api/auth` endpoint returns proper user data
2. **Signals CRUD**: PUT/DELETE methods for complete admin functionality  
3. **Route Protection**: Only admin users can access `/admin/signals`

## Test After Deployment

1. Login as admin: `admin@forexsignals.com`
2. Navigate to: `https://watchlistfx.netlify.app/admin/signals`  
3. Verify: No more 404 errors, full CRUD functionality working

The fix is ready - just run those deployment commands to resolve the admin signals 404 issue!
