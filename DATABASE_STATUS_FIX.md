# Database Status Compatibility Fix

## Problem Identified
Production Neon database only contains these subscription statuses:
- `active` 
- `free trial`

But admin interface was trying to set:
- `inactive`
- `expired` 
- `trial`

## Solution Applied

### Status Mapping
Frontend → Database mapping:
- `trial` → `free trial` (direct mapping)
- `active` → `active` (direct mapping)
- `inactive` → `active` with past end_date (effectively expired)
- `expired` → `active` with past end_date (effectively expired)

### Updated Netlify Function Logic
1. **Status Validation**: Accept frontend status values but map to database values
2. **Date-Based Status**: Use end_date logic to determine effective status
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Frontend displays correct status based on date calculations

### Database Operations
- **Expired/Inactive**: Set status='active' but end_date = yesterday
- **Trial**: Set status='free trial' with 7-day duration  
- **Active Plans**: Set status='active' with plan duration

This maintains database integrity while supporting all admin interface functionality.
