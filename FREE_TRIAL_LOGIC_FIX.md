# Free Trial Access Logic Fix

## 🚨 **Issue**
Users selecting free trial were immediately shown upgrade prompt instead of accessing signals during their trial period.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
Frontend logic was showing upgrade prompt for ANY 403 error, even for trial users with remaining days.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### Frontend Fix (client/src/pages/Signals.tsx)
1. **Added subscription status check**: Query user's subscription details before deciding to show upgrade prompt
2. **Enhanced logic**: Only show upgrade when `daysLeft === 0` OR status is `inactive/expired`
3. **Trial protection**: Users with active trial (days > 0) will see signals, not upgrade prompt

### Key Logic Changes
```javascript
// OLD: Show upgrade for any 403 error
if (errorMessage.includes('subscription') || errorMessage.includes('403')) {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}

// NEW: Check if user actually has expired trial/subscription
const shouldShowUpgrade = (errorMessage.includes('subscription') || errorMessage.includes('403')) && 
                         (!subscriptionStatus || subscriptionStatus.daysLeft === 0 || 
                          subscriptionStatus.status === 'inactive' || subscriptionStatus.status === 'expired');
```

## 📋 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### Free Trial Users (7 days)
- ✅ **Days 1-7**: See signals normally with auto-refresh
- ✅ **Day 8+**: See upgrade prompt when trial expires

### Active Subscribers  
- ✅ **Active period**: See signals normally
- ✅ **After expiry**: See upgrade prompt

### Inactive Users
- ✅ **Always**: See upgrade prompt immediately

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**
Ready for GitHub push to deploy fix to live site.
